It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest).

<p>The majority of security cameras can be used both indoors and outdoors. They usually have the exact same features like night vision or remote viewing, but they vary in resilience. Outdoor cameras must be weather resistant and in some cases, totally waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance ranking are the most durable. Because their style allows for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor alternatives. In regards to detection, it is much better to have a camera geared up with infrared detection as opposed to motion detection. Because often times the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will offer more precise and less frequent informs.</p>
