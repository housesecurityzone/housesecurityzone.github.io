It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest).

Outdoor cameras must be weather resistant and in some cases, totally waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance ranking are the most durable.

In regards to detection, it is much better to have a camera geared up with infrared detection as opposed to motion detection. Because often times the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will offer more precise and less frequent informs.</p>
<p>Last, we likewise consider just how much it costs to see, share and conserve taped video.
