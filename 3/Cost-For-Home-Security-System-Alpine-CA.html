<p>Reasons and responsibilities: We need to consider privacy problems when developing surveillance policies. For one, cameras must prevent or mask improper views of personal areas, such as backyards and windows of bed rooms or bathrooms.

The privacy-conscious will be pleased to hear there's a physical shutter you can close over the camera when you're at home and don't want to be recorded.</p>

By ordinance, only incorrect alarms triggered by typhoons, twisters, earthquake or other catastrophic occasions, go through appeal. Alarms activated by electrical storms, thunder, hail, or sudden changes in temperature level do not satisfy the standards for waiver of false alarm fees. Alarms activated by legal however accidental entry to the property, i.e. children returning home, visitors, next-door neighbors caring for the home while you are on vacation and delivery males do not meet the standard for waiver.</p>
