Alarms activated by electrical storms, thunder, hail, or sudden changes in temperature level do not satisfy the standards for waiver of false alarm fees. Alarms activated by legal however accidental entry to the property, i.e. children returning home, visitors, next-door neighbors caring for the home while you are on vacation and delivery males do not meet the standard for waiver.</p>
