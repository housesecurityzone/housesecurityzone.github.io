<p>Do It Yourself home security systems using cutting-edge technology, impressive service, and overall home automation. While we've continued to examine these devices for personal privacy and security, there have been several reports of connected security cameras, including video doorbells, getting hacked.

That means the camera will wait 5 minutes before it's able to tape-record once again, which means you might be missing a lot. Wyze's just recently launched Total Motion Capture solves this issue for $1.50 monthly per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for approximately 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly begins another, without any gaps in between.

<p>The main advantage of unmonitored security systems is cost.

A room's lighting conditions constantly changing, 24 hr a day. Low light, high brightness, and high-exposure environments all affect a camera's imaging quality.
