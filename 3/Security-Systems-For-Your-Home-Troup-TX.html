<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>

Your alarm company need to be accredited, pay any registration or incorrect alarm costs, and offer physical proof like camera footage or a broken window to necessitate cops reaction.</p>
