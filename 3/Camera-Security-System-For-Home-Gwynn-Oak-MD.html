Amongst IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras collect and send out data over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A common mistaken belief is that wireless indicates the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras may still require a power cord. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder straight which then links to the internet and a router. Lastly, wire-free cameras are entirely cable television totally free and battery powered. Although battery replacements are needed, these are the simplest choice to install and all of the tape-recorded footage is stored in the cloud.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
