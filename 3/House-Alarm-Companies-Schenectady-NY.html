<h3>Commercial Alarm Systems Schenectady NY 12303</h3>
<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm system, a variety of companies provide "free monitoring services" for the first couple of months. Many insurance provider offer discount rates on insurance premiums to customers with operable alarm. These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous authorities departments use a number of "free" incorrect alarms before enforcing any fine, although the cost to respond is considerable right from the start. The offers of free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers cast doubt on the appropriateness of the current pattern in U.S. policing of permitting 3 or 4 complimentary false alarms per fiscal year, since they supply no up-front incentives to encourage owners to avoid false alarms.</p>
