<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter occasion alerts only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs whenever you walk by.

Alarm companies must furnish homeowners with instructions that provide adequate information to run and preserve the alarm system.
