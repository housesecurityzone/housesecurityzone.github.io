<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment.

Need to be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
