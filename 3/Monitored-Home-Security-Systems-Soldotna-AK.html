<p>The majority of security cameras can be utilized both inside and outdoors. They generally have the exact same features like night vision or remote watching, but they differ in resilience. Outdoor cameras should be weather condition resistant and in many cases, completely water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance ranking are the most durable. Due to the fact that their style permits for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor alternatives. In terms of detection, it is much better to have a camera equipped with infrared detection as opposed to motion detection.
