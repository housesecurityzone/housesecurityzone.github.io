<p>All About Security provides expert, dependable alarm monitoring services for homes and businesses throughout the greater Indianapolis location. Figure 1-1 depicts an example of a CCTV installation that keeps track of select locations of protection. The very first installation was designed and developed for the separate parking facility. This implementation included several fixed position cameras on each floor of the parking garage, stairwells, and exits, all linked straight to a main control system (PCU) for management of each video stream. The PCU is an easy device for managing the input and output of video feeds through the coax cable televisions. Secondary utilities and devices can offer easy integration of some alarms, however this technology has restricted abilities and an intricate integration procedure.</p>

I called their customer support group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to discuss it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the swelling amount, since apparently they car restore you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.
