Our tester went with the Interactive plan but wound up disappointed with its lack of live video surveillance.

<p>Wireless security cameras being tested in a Customer Reports laboratory. You can set off the 80dB alarm if you do encounter a home intrusion emergency situation. I am slightly dissatisfied by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas many other alarm are as loud as 90dB and even 105dB. Despite that, the alarm ought to suffice to scare away burglars most of the times. Security cameras are a great start to protecting your home.
