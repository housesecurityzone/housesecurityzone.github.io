<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>
