<p>Everyone we dealt with at NSS were really handy and accommodating. The services they offered were precisely what we wanted, and they performed with professionalism and proficiency. I'm unsure if any consumer-grade outdoor camera carries out all that well when it's foggy or raining, especially during the night when weather conditions actually tinker the night vision. Still, you're right about the Arlo Pro refraining from doing anything to keep rain from hitting the lens cover.</p>
