<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals every time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
