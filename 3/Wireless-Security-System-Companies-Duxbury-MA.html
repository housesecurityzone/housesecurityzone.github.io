Since Blink (and Ring) are owned by Amazon, the Blink app likewise has a connection to Ring's Neighbors app, where you can see a feed of other incidents in your community, and post videos from your Blink camera. Blink's app is relatively robust, and while it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of Arlo's cameras, this sub-$ 100 has plenty of functions for the cost.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
