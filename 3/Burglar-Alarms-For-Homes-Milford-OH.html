<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
