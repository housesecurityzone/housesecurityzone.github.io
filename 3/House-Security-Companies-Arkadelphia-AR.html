No matter where you live, there's always an opportunity your home could be targeted by cold-hearted bad guys. However as you know, home security systems can protect you and your family versus other disasters, too.</p>
<p>The huge distinction in between wired and wireless systems is how signals are received. While wired systems depend on radio frequency, wireless security uses cellular signals.

<p>We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for among our top spots. However, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape-record as much as 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, however entries were often missing, despite showing up in the app's activity timeline.
