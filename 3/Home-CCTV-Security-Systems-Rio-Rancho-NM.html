For a sharp image, you'll desire a camera that can contend least in 720p high definition, which suggests an IP camera. If you want to guarantee that your camera will have a clear, recognizable image, you don't want to cut corners here.

We value that the company continues to iterate and improve an item that costs about as much as a pizza.
