<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular considering that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level.
