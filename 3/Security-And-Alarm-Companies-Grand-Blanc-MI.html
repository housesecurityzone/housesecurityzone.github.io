<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
