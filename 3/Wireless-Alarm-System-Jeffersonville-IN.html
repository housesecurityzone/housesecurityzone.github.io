<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
