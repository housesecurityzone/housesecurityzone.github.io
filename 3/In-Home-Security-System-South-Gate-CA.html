<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is spotting utilizing face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send out mobile phone alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish anticipated visitors from random strangers.

<h3>Home Monitoring Equipment South Gate CA 90280</h3>

Cellular systems utilize cell towers to communicate with the monitoring center as well as a battery backup that can keep them up and running for several hours until the electric service is restored. Landline systems utilize traditional phone lines to communicate with the monitoring center and, similar to cellular systems, they normally have a battery backup to keep them working for a set time period.</p>
