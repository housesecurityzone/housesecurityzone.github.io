For that reason, updating to newer sensing units usually suggests needing to change a whole wireless system.</p>
<p>When it concerns innovation, reliability is an extremely subjective matter, depending on which features and benefits a specific favors. Wireless security systems are more nimble and integratable, however low signal strength and poor connection are still common problems.

<p>The Wyze Cam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Formerly, we didn't consider it to be an effective security alternative (although we enjoyed it as an animal webcam ).

We value that the company continues to iterate and improve a product that costs about as much as a pizza. Nevertheless, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other picks, it has a restricted field of vision, and Wyze says it plans to do away with individual detection, at least briefly (more on that in a minute).</p>
