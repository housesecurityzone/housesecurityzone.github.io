Wyze's just recently launched Complete Motion Capture fixes this problem for $1.50 each month per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately starts another, without any gaps in between. Recordings are simple to find under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the restricted cloud recording and microSD recording, however we do not recommend that for home security because if it's taken, you do not have a backup.</p>
