<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security specialists looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is an excellent security camera and an incredible worth. It gets an Excellent rating for video quality and is easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid subscription plans for extra cloud storage.

Instead, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
