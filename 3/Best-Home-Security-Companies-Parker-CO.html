<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later on produced to address the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or brief character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked.

The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
