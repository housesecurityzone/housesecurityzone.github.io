<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
