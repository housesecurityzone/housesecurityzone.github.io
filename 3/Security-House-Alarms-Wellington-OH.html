<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
