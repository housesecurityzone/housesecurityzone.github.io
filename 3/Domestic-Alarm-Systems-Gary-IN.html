<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies whenever you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
