<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: Go to Ring for a well-priced DIY system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small fee. We advise the eight-piece package due to the fact that it features numerous door and window sensors for complete coverage. We also advise adding a doorbell video camera eventually. The upfront cost of wireless security systems can be pricey. Consider the upfront cost of the control board, activation fees, monitoring fees and all equipment. All of these expenses will be paid upfront if the wireless security system is not on a contract basis. Some clients report spending $500 up to $2,000 to kickstart their wireless security system.</p>
