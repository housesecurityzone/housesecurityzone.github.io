<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later on created to address the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be broken. Using an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly picked words) makes pre-shared key WPA practically uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i amendment to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
