<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a pleasure to utilize as well (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you wish to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little a knowing curve. For even more basic smarts, it's excellent, though. If you do not already have an Arlo camera or two in place, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all link to the hub (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can indicate there are range problems.</p>
