The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared with 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). Nevertheless, after nearly 2 years of use, day and night images have actually constantly been clear, and we never had problems with the camera missing motion, a problem we encountered when testing the Wyze Webcam Pan And for those times when you're left wondering why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a clever feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It develops a green, on-screen box around the motion detected. We have actually seen it highlight moths, mice, and cars and trucks.</p>
