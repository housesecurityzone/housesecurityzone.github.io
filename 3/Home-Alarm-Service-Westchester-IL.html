"Once the crime and offence figures were gotten used to appraise the basic downward pattern in crimes and offences," criminologists found in one research study, "decreases were kept in mind in certain classifications however there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had minimized crime overall in the city centre."

Not only is the Arlo fast to choose moving products, it's brainy enough to make a decent stab at working out exactly what it's looking at.
