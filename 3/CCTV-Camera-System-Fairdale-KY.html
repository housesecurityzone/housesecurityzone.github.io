<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our testing-- during the day and at night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the image quality based upon available bandwidth, which might change throughout the day.

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on two AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of totally free cloud storage, and it captures a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smartphone notices and live views were painfully slow, and the range is bad.
