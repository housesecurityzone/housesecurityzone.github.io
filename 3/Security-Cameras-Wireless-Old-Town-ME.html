<p>Windows and door sensors are contact motion sensors that trigger an alarm when the safeguarded door or window opens.

<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It needs an addition hard disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The photo quality is good. The motion sensors work well.

Outdoor security cameras inevitably cost more than their indoor cousins, because-- for starters-- the need to be secured from the aspects.

<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is an enjoyment to use as well (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you wish to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a learning curve. For even more basic smarts, it's great, though.
