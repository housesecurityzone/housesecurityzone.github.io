In long-term testing of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic location. If you're worried about charging, Arlo offers a photovoltaic panel, which we have actually not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that varied between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-lasting screening, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained the camera to the point where it required a complete charge once a month.</p>
