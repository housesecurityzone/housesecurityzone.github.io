All of the cameras in an offered system require a main video recorder in order to transmit and archive the footage they are catching.

<p>In a current New York Times short article about Chicago's 911 expanding digital video surveillance system, Albert Alschuler, a law teacher at Northwestern University, makes the point that public camera systems do not breach any personal privacy concerns because they are set up in public locations. They have actually been carried out for public safety and criminal activity prevention and are not for the exploitation of individuals. A specific with a camcorder, or the paparazzi, might have a more self-satisfying program and thanks to digital technology and the Internet can break personal privacy laws with far more disastrous consequences than video surveillance cameras, which are kept secured and in rigorous self-confidence.</p>
<p>Remote web capabilities allow you to visit from anywhere to see pre-recorded or live video feeds and monitor your home anytime. Check in on liked family pets and ones when you're away, or a service employee accessing your home. IP-based cameras perform the same function as analog ones, but with a host of extra capabilities.
