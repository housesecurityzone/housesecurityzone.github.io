<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, accommodating innovative smart home connoisseurs or fans of a particular ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, including creative things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit. But the Secure is costly, extra sensors are costly, and the monitoring service-- which does not consist of fire alarms or camera backups-- is likewise costly if you don't commit to a three-year agreement.</p>
<p>That, together with facial acknowledgment and a built-in Google Assistant, still make the Nest IQ Outdoor cameras a top pick for outdoor security. If you choose power-over-ethernet (POE) cameras to wireless security cameras, then the Nest Web Cam IQ is an obvious choice. In addition, keep an eye on your camera logs to see when they have been accessed. If you notice camera activity at odd hours or at times when you understand that no one is at home, it might be an indicator that your system has been compromised. Finally, make sure your system software application and all of your connected gadgets depend on date. Firmware updates typically resolve security problems and can help secure your system from seepage.</p>
