<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later developed to resolve the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption schemes, any customer in the network that knows the keys can read all the traffic.</p>

If home security is your main concern, we 'd recommend among our top choices, but the Arlo is great for checking in on family and pets-- or stray felines slipping around your backyard.</p>
