<h3>New Home Security Systems in North Carolina</h3>
<p>The majority of video doorbells (like the RemoBell S) use your existing doorbell wiring (two low-voltage wires) and are fairly simple to install, but there are battery-powered models readily available (like the Ring Video Doorbell 2) that install in minutes.

<p>Video recording isn't a basic option on many security systems. Property owners searching for a system that uses video recording need to ensure the choice is offered rather than presume it is. Saving video is also an issue. Video files are large, which means a lot of area is required. There are a handful of companies that offer complimentary video storage, however the video is sent out to a cloud account and only kept for a couple of days. For longer access to video, anticipate to pay a month-to-month storage cost.</p>
<p>So far so regular. Things begin to get really intriguing with the Nest's facial recognition system. If the camera detects a face it doesn't identify, it will send out a notification and image to your phone, enabling you to give that individual the once over. If it's someone getting up to no good, the camera will follow their movements and conserve the timestamp, so you can quickly discover it in the future.
