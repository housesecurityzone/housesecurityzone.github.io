<p>Wireless security cameras being evaluated in a Consumer Reports laboratory. If you do encounter a home invasion emergency, you can activate the 80dB alarm. I am slightly disappointed by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food processor whereas many other alarm are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB.
