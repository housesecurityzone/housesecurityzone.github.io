<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
