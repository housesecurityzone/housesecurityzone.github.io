<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our testing-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the image quality based on readily available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day.

<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or completely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, should offer a minimum of a number of months of operation on a charge (depending on use). The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses 7 days of totally free cloud storage (with more available for a monthly charge ). However, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo says will allow the camera to correctly discover motion and not get stuck taping on a loop. That also saves battery life, but it might leave you with recording gaps throughout essential security events. If home security is your primary concern, we 'd recommend one of our top choices, but the Arlo is fantastic for signing in on family and animals-- or roaming felines slipping around your yard.</p>
