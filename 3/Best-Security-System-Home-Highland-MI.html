Despite the fact that it does not have the widest operating temperature range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the couple of cameras on our list that featured a truly weatherproof cable and plug.

The 2nd generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 standard and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
