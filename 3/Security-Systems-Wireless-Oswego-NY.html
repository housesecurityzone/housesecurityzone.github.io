<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
