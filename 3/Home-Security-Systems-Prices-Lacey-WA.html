<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
