The very same is true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much photo information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no.

<p>Indoor cameras are terrific for watching on your kids and family pets, but if you're worried about security, you don't wish to run the risk of missing out on a second of the action.
