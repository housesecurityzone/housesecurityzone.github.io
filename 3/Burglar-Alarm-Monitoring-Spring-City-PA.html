<p>Another crucial topic to talk about is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand how much is enough. In this article, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video image; the more dots, the more detailed the video image. The very same is true of high-resolution Television Set, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much photo information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it comes to surveillance cameras, there are some challenging consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always better.</p>

<p>Indoor cameras are terrific for watching on your kids and family pets, but if you're worried about security, you don't wish to run the risk of missing out on a second of the action.

Although it does not have the widest operating temperature range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is one of the few cameras on our list that come with a genuinely weatherproof cord and plug. That treatment makes the cord rather thick, so you can't actually run it through a window opening.</p>

PTZ cameras are from another location controlled, and permit the operator to pan (relocation left or ideal), tilt up and or down, or zoom better or farther away in order to follow people as they move.
