Our tester chose the Interactive strategy but wound up disappointed with its absence of live video surveillance. When she got an alarm notification while on vacation, she had no other way of determining whether her home had been gotten into or if her cat had managed to journey the sensor. It ended up being an incorrect alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
