<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
