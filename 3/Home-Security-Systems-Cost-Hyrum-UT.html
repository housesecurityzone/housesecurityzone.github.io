<p>Houston locals have options when it pertains to home security systems. You can select a nationally acknowledged brand or go with a local company.

Due this spring, the Arlo Pro 3 Floodlight is an outdoor camera integrated with a 2,000-lumen light in a completely wire-free fixture. (You can pump that light up to 3,000 lumens by integrating the battery with outdoor cabling). It also has a lot of the Arlo Pro 3's features, including 2K recording, two-way audio, and a built-in siren. Also like the camera, it requires an Arlo Smart membership to shop video recordings.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
