<p>In a current New york city Times article about Chicago's 911 broadening digital video surveillance system, Albert Alschuler, a law professor at Northwestern University, makes the point that public camera systems do not violate any personal privacy concerns since they are installed in public areas. They have been implemented for public safety and criminal activity avoidance and are not for the exploitation of individuals.

<p>I" m not pleased with this product. It needs an addition disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The picture quality is good. The motion sensing units work well.

<p>For wise home functions, we suggest the ADT Pulse package.
