<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Likewise great metal building and construction.

Must be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
