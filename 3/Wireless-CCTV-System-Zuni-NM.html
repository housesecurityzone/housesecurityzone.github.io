<p>We have actually all heard that old saying, you get what you spend for". Want to add a flood sensing unit? A wise door lock? Your system can function as a center for approximately 119 clever home gadgets, and can be controlled through Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple TV, and more. IP cameras can also be connected to what is known as a "power over Ethernet" (PoE) switch, which both sends out information from the camera and offers power to it. Analog cameras, on the other hand, need a switch to run the signal from the camera in addition to a separate source of power, meaning a more complex setup and more wires. PoE switches are also typically considered a more secure method to send data.</p>

<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, due to the fact that it is instead connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
