<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
