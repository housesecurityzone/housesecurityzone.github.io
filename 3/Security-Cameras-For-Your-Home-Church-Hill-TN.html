The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what provides the video history and smarter alerts, for instance. Nevertheless, those features come at a relatively high rate: $5 monthly ($50 per year) for the first camera for five days of video history, $10 each month ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 each month ($300 each year) for one month of video history.

It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>
