In San Francisco, the Union Square Business Improvement District introduced an outdoor security camera program in 2012 with simply 6 independently owned cameras. Now it is a surveillance network of 350 cameras, all of which share video with the cops.

In addition, be aware that lots of cloud services charge a subscription charge to use their offerings, especially to keep video files in eternity.

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts whenever you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
