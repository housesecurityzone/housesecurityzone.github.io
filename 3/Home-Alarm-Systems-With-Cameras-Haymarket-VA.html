<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. CR's take: The Wyze Webcam V2 is an excellent security camera and a sensational worth. It receives an Excellent rating for video quality and is easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of totally free storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save footage in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid membership plans for additional cloud storage. However the company does use a Total Motion Capture service that continually records for as long as motion is detected. Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>The Canary is among the biggest cameras we tested, and it uses two-way communication with its paid Canary Subscription. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent throughout our screening. The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And in spite of having an appealing price and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 per year to the cost of an otherwise budget plan camera.</p>
