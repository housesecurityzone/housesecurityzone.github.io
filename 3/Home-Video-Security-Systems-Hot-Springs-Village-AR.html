<h3>Home Security System Review in Arkansas</h3>
<p>When using IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do these days - you will probably be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, but not compatible with IP cameras.
