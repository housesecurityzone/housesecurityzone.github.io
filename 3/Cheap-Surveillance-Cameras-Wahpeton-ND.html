<p>SmartThings was likewise a past candidate. However, it requires a lot of effort to get the system to function as a home security system.

Also, the app stays challenging to navigate, though they are migrating users to a more recent app called 'SmartThings Connect' which has potential. Similar to Vizzini's overuse of unthinkable" in The Princess Bride-to-be, home security companies like to throw around the word wireless" quite freely. We get it. It's a buzzword that offers the convenience of equipment with no strings attached. But wireless" can actually suggest a few different things for a home security system, and it can get confusing.</p>

<p>I" m not pleased with this item. It requires an addition hard drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The picture quality is decent. The motion sensors work well. I would not suggest it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pressed for time might prefer to install their own systems to prevent scheduling consultations and requiring time off from work. Contacting a technician costs more, but for those who choose to let a professional deal with the job and don't mind investing the money, professional installation is the method to go.</p>
<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
