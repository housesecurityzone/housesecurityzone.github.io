Amongst IP security options, there are wired, wireless, and wire-free cameras. Wireless cameras gather and send data over a wireless network. These security cameras connect to a user's home wifi network and allows that user to see the video footage from anywhere. A common misconception is that wireless suggests the camera is wire-free. This is not the case as wireless cameras might still need a power cable. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder straight which then connects to the web and a router. Lastly, wire-free cameras are entirely cable totally free and battery powered.
