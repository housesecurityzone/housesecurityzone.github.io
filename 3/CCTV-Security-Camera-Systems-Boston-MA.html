<p>The NVR removes these problems, due to the fact that it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, usually by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll require to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with a provided video recorder before purchasing.</p>
