<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
