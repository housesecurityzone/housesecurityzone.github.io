So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no concept I was in, to get out I need to pay $783.  Really irritating. Again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not discuss the 3 year dedication. I called their customer care group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to discuss it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the swelling amount, since apparently they vehicle restore you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a composed not by mail.

<p>Unlike many other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals every time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
