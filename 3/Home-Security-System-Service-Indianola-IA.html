<p>I explained that all we would need to do is use any one of the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, which camera would become the interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency button, it sends dual alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the risk and, if required, might simply push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>
