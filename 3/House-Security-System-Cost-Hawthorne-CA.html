In Britain, where cameras have actually been thoroughly deployed in public locations, sociologists studying the problem have actually discovered that they have actually not decreased crime. "When the criminal offense and offence figures were adjusted to take account of the general downward pattern in offences and criminal activities," criminologists found in one research study, "reductions were kept in mind in particular classifications however there was no evidence to recommend that the cameras had actually minimized criminal activity in general in the city centre."
