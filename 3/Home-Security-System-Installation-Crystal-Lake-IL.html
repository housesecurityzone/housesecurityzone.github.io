Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more signals, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
