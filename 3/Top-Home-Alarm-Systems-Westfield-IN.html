<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal because the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
