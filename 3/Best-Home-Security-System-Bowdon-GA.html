<p>Security: There have been a lot of headlines about hackers compromising home cameras, baby displays, and other Wi-Fi devices to spy on individuals, so make certain to examine what actions has actually each producer taken to remove this problem. Look for a camera that supports updated wireless security procedures, such as WPA2, and make certain it encrypts internet transmission of your user name, your password, and the live feeds. Never install a security camera (or a router or any other device on your home network) without changing its default user ID and password.</p>
