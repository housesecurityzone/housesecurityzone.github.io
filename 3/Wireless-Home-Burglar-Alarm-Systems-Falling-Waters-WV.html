<p>Arlo declares that you should have the ability to get 4 to six months out of a totally charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature. In long-term testing of the camera, we typically got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo offers a solar panel, which we have not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout screening, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that changed between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-term testing, we put the camera in a business parking lot that saw a good amount of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it required a complete charge once a month.</p>
