With the normal weatherproof hoods, they're quite resilient, but they don't constantly come with the full IP certification of other designs.</p>
<p>Think about it this way, if a good still-camera costs a minimum of 2 hundred and fifty dollars (United States $), how can a more sophisticated camera be sold for the low price of forty dollars? It simply does not accumulate. To provide such low prices, makers must cut corners, and completion outcome is jeopardized performance.
