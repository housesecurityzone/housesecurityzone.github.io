<p>Emergency dialer: If you don't want to connect to a monitoring service, buy a dialer and program it to call and play a recorded message to next-door neighbors and pals to notify them of an alarm at your home.

Professional installation by a security company is a good idea if you need to follow the best practices and mitigate the danger of security breaches.
