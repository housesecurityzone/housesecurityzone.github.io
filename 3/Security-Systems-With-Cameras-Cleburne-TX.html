<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording video footage in the dark is a priority.</p>

Here is what this means, by way of an example. Presume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image throughout a far bigger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
