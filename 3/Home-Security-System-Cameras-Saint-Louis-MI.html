These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see during the night. If capturing video footage in the dark is a top priority, make certain your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical because the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
