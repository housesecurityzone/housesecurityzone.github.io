In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.

It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest).
