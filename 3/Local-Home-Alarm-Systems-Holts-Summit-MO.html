<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
