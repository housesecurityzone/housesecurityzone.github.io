<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare individuals and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
