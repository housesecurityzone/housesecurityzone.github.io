Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, including clever things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. However the Secure is pricey, additional sensing units are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't include fire alarms or camera backups-- is likewise pricey if you don't dedicate to a three-year contract.</p>
