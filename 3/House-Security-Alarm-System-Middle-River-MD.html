The answer hinges on a couple of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you plan to keep and the length of time you prepare to keep documented video. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to consume storage area rapidly.
