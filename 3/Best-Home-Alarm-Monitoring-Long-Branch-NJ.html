<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests possible transgressors are less most likely to devote criminal offense if they think they are being enjoyed or have a higher risk of being captured. This is also referred to as the reasonable choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance method, which argues that chances to offend can be minimized by altering a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the danger of a culprit being nabbed, increasing the effort to devote the criminal offense, reducing benefits from crime commission, and reducing provocations that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).

<p>The night vision on this camera is applauded time and again in customer reviews, and it delivers a crisp picture up to 32 feet.

A great deal of smart cameras can be configured to do things like this, but few make things as simple as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is expected to make our lives simpler and Hive's environment lives up to that. It's all the function with no disappointment.</p>
