This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are trusted, however not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for more electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might need less wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera individually, typically by means of 110VAC power.</p>

<p>A taut wire perimeter security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to find any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to neglect items that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.</p>
