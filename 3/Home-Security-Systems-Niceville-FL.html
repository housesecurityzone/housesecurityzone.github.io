<p>But monitored systems likewise tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey regular monthly cost for a set amount of time, usually one to five years. No-contract systems, which allow you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of dedicating to a long-term arrangement, are ending up being more typical. These systems often cost more up front for the hardware than pro systems that provide a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service agreement.
