Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals each time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>

<p>I" m not pleased with this item. It needs an addition disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The picture quality is decent. The motion sensing units work well. I wouldn't advise it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pressed for time may choose to install their own systems to prevent scheduling visits and requiring time off from work.
