<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
