This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear effectively exposed and completely detail. It has actually limited effectiveness if a camera can not capture and deliver a properly-exposed and sharp  image throughout the day and at night.</p>

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs whenever you walk by.
