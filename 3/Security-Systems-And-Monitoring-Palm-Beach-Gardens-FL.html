<p>Most home security cameras carry out the very same basic functions-- they discover an event, record the event, and send you an alert-- however they don't all perform them the same way.

<p>The NVR gets rid of these problems, since it is rather linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
