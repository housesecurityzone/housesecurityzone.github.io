<p>The Wyze Camera v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Formerly, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security alternative (although we enjoyed it as an animal webcam ). It has actually because been enhanced and now matches our top choices due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and a number of smart-home integration choices. We appreciate that the company continues to repeat and enhance a product that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't rather as good as on our other choices, it has a restricted field of vision, and Wyze states it plans to do away with individual detection, a minimum of briefly (more on that in a minute).</p>

<p>But monitored systems likewise tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey regular monthly charge for a set quantity of time, generally one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of dedicating to a long-lasting plan, are ending up being more common. These systems in some cases cost more up front for the hardware than professional systems that offer a discount rate in exchange for that lengthy service arrangement. Paying for the equipment up front provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can start and stop the monitoring service as often times as you desire.</p>

That generally implies you can sign up for a monitoring service on an optional basis and cancel at any time - without early termination costs or other hidden charges. Factors we considered included the quality of the security cameras (do they have motion detection and night vision?), is there a monitoring strategy, can window sensors and door sensing units be included, whether the system had a mobile app, can it work with your door locks and can it be integrated into an existing wise home setup, including with voice commands through Amazon Alexa.</p>
