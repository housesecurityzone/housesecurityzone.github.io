<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
