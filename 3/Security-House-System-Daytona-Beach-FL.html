When utilized in high-traffic locations, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals every time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
