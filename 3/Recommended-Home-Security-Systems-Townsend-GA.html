<p>All of the cameras were easy to install. Each camera has an app that walks you through the setup process. This generally includes finding an area for your camera, creating an account in the app, and connecting the camera to your Wi-Fi network. A number of them then permit you to create and configure the alert frequency activity monitoring zones, so the camera will capture motion only in designated areas-- a feature we find needed for high-traffic locations, which could trigger a lot of incorrect informs.</p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas detection. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that can be hazardous to both people and animals. Since carbon monoxide gas is colorless and odorless, the only way to monitor hazardous levels of this gas is with a carbon monoxide gas detector.

For example, if a motion detector trips in one area, the signal is recorded and the central-station monitor alerts the client. A 2nd alarm signal-- received in a nearby zone within a brief time-- is the verification the central-station monitor requires to request a dispatch right away. This builds in increased protection and a stop working safe need to a door blow open or a bird rattle an exterior window.</p>
