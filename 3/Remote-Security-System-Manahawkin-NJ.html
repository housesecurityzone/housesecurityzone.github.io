<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a harmful assailant, since the disturbance of the network avoids the flow of information and actually indirectly safeguards information by preventing it from being sent. The normal reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, providing a chance for the destructive attacker to tape these codes and use various splitting tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system.
