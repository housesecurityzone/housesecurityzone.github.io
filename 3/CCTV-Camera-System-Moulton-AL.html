<p>Efficient in running in both regular and inadequately lit environments, these cameras benefit from not needing integrated infrared illuminators as they can record clear video images in the dark thanks to their additional delicate imaging chips.

It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
