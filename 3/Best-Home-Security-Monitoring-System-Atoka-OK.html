Nevertheless, in any circumstance where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be bad because the optimum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these gadgets is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the outcomes are the exact same); they typically capture horizontal and vertical fields of lines and blend them together to make a single frame; the optimum frame rate is usually 30 frames per second.</p>
