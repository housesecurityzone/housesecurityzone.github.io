<p>Our SSA security system was installed at our new home on Friday, June 23rd. Ron Thompson was our sales expert. He supplied the recommendations concerning what was needed for our home and was on-site for the installation. Darek handled the installation and arrived right on time. He consulted with us relating to placement of some of the monitoring devices in our home. He also helped me in packing the app and completing the online set-up procedure. He likewise examined the new keypad functionality. Both Darek and Ron were handy and extremely expert. Thanks.</p>
<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>

<p>They are so commonplace that the majority of us do not even observe them any longer: the little guards or decals indicating that a property is protected" by a home security system.
