<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much larger area and for that reason offers fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by way of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far bigger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest).
