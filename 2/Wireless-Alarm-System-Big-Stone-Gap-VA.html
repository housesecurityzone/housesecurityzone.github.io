<p>A tight wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to neglect items that exert percentages of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is set up to avoid this kind of attack.</p>
