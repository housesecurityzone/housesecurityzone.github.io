<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It requires an addition hard drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is decent. The motion sensors work well. I would not advise it though. People who are tech-savvy or pressed for time may prefer to install their own systems to prevent scheduling appointments and taking time off from work. Contacting a specialist costs more, but for those who choose to let a professional deal with the job and don't mind spending the additional money, professional installation is the way to go.</p>
