<p>When it comes to home security systems, a base station is the hub that links all your different sensing units and gadgets together.

<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is an enjoyment to utilize as well (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you want to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little a learning curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's terrific, though. If you don't currently have an Arlo camera or two in place, you're going to require to install a center that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the hub (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can mean there are range issues.</p>
