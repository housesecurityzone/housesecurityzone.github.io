<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
