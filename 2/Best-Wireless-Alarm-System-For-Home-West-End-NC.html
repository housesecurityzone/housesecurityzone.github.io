The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
