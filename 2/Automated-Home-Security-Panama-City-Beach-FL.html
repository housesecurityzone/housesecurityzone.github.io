<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month fee for a set amount of time, usually one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which allow you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis instead of devoting to a long-term plan, are becoming more common. These systems sometimes cost more in advance for the hardware than professional systems that offer a discount rate in exchange for that lengthy service contract. Spending for the equipment in advance provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can begin and stop the monitoring service as lot of times as you want.</p>
