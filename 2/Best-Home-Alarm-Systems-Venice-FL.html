Wyze's just recently introduced Complete Motion Capture fixes this problem for $1.50 each month per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately starts another, with no gaps in between. Recordings are easy to find under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the limited cloud recording and microSD recording, however we don't advise that for home security due to the fact that if it's stolen, you don't have a backup.</p>
