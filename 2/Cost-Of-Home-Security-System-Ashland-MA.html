<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can recognize people the camera is finding using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send out smart device informs with that info when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings.</p>
