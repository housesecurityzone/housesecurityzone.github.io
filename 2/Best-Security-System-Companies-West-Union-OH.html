<p>I" m not pleased with this product. It needs an addition hard disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is good. The motion sensors work well. I would not recommend it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pressed for time might choose to install their own systems to prevent scheduling appointments and requiring time off from work.

<p>A taut wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that notice motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to ignore items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is set up to prevent this type of attack.</p>
