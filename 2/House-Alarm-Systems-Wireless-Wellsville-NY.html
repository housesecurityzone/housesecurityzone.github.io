<p>I've blogged about customer electronics for more than 15 years, and I've evaluated a range of smart-home items-- whatever from remotes and security cameras to AV receivers and speakers. As a previous editor for Electronic House and Big Picture Big Noise, I've composed purchaser's guides for numerous consumer-electronics devices. I've also done tech-related work for The New York Times, Wired, Men's Health, and others.</p>
<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later produced to resolve the problems with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared crucial WPA practically uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those file encryption schemes, any client in the network that understands the secrets can check out all the traffic.</p>
<p>The night vision on this camera is applauded time and once again in consumer reviews, and it provides a crisp image up to 32 feet. And although the app and software are easy to work with, it's a little bit of a letdown that you can't integrate this camera with any smart home hubs or gizmos. A lot of smart cameras can be set to do things like this, but few make things as simple as Hive have actually done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is expected to make our lives much easier and Hive's community lives up to that. It's all the function without any disappointment.</p>
