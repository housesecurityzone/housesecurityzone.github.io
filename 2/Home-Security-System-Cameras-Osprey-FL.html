Yale is associated with home security and the yellow siren boxes are a huge turn-off for would-be intruders. In the past you 'd need deep pockets to have a Yale system professionally installed (and then monitored for an additional cost) but the Smart Living range is Do It Yourself, wireless and app-controlled.</p>
