<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, because it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR.

Some house owners post decoy alarm indications hoping they'll discourage potential intruders.
