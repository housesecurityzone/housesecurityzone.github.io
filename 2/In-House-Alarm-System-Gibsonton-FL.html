The good-looking shiny black cube, magnetically affixed to a brushed metal stand (mine was available in a beautiful rose-gold however you can likewise get it in silver) strikes the perfect balance between subtle and good-looking adequate to not accentuate itself.

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between people and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
