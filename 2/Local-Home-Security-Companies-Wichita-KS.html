<p>Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer depends upon a couple of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you plan to save and how long you plan to keep recorded video. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video footage is going to consume storage space rapidly. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video once you reach the system's capability, however if you're not mindful, the system may overwrite archived video that you still require.</p>

These cameras are true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clearness is actually excellent.
