<p>All persons with alarm securing a facility in the City of Fredericksburg should have a valid alarm permit. The integration of digital video surveillance and gain access to control is part of the natural convergence of security innovations. Centralizing security into a single user interface uses additional details that may never ever have been possible before, such as notification of an employee, by name and identification number, going into the building. A picture of that worker is presented on screen for verification (confirming it's not a taken ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, ensuring no tailgating takes place.</p>
<p>If a worker (trusted entity) brings in a wireless router and plugs it into an unsecured switchport, the entire network can be exposed to anybody within range of the signals.
