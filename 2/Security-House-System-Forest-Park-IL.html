<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely typical since the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
