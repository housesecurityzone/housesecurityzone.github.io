<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
