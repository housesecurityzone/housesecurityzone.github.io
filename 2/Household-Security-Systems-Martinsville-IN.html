<p>That depends upon your spending plan and comfort with threat. Initially glance, a $40 or $50 monthly monitoring cost can appear steep, however that amounts to $600 or less per year. Remember that the more functions and extras you contribute to your system, the bigger the price. Some top-tier packages cost upward of $60 per month. That's still substantial, however it's a lot less than the average loss of a break-in.

Rather, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals every time you walk by.
