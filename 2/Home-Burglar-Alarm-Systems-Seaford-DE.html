<p>The Hive View delivers terrific 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting. Given that this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to by hand stop notifications (and recording, given that it does that even when alerts are off). We likewise experienced above-average connectivity problems, with two Hive test systems detaching 8 times over 2 months. Scout is very easy to utilize, particularly if you're a fan of mobile phones. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based web browsers, and it permits you to manage nearly every element of the security system remotely, and it's extremely adjustable.

<p>Conserving uncompressed digital recordings uses up a huge quantity of hard drive area, and a couple of hours of uncompressed video might rapidly fill a disk drive. Holiday uncompressed recordings might look fine but one might not run uncompressed quality recordings on a continuous basis.
