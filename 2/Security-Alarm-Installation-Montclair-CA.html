<p>Get best-in-class security, plus smart home automation the whole family will enjoy. It's a neat technique, and one that works quite well, however just when you have actually set up the remainder of the settings. I've got a huge pet dog, so needed to specify the locations for the camera to discover i.e. at adult chest height near doors, not low down where the dog will be walking.
