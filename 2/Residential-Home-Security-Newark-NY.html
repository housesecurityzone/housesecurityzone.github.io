<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
