<p>Arlo declares that you ought to have the ability to get 4 to six months out of a completely charged battery, depending upon settings, use, and surrounding temperature level. In long-lasting screening of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're worried about charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have actually not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that fluctuated between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-term screening, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera down to the point where it required a full charge once a month.</p>
