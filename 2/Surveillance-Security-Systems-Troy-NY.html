Wyze's just recently introduced Total Motion Capture solves this problem for $1.50 each month per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly starts another, without any spaces in between. Recordings are easy to discover under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, but we do not recommend that for home security since if it's taken, you don't have a backup.</p>
