<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ).

When utilized in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you walk by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
