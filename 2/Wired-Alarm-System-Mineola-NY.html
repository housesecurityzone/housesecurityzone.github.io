<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
