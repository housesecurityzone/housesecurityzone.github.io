<h3>Cheapest Home Security System Monitoring in Virginia</h3>
<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our testing-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We need to note that the camera would sometimes downgrade the picture quality based on offered bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day. Nest includes the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that might defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
<p>The Hive View provides fantastic 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting. Considering that this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to by hand stop alerts (and recording, considering that it does that even when alerts are off). We likewise experienced above-average connectivity problems, with two Hive test units disconnecting eight times over 2 months.

<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: Go to Ring for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small fee. We recommend the eight-piece package due to the fact that it comes with multiple door and window sensing units for complete protection. We also recommend adding a doorbell camera at some point.
