<p>The Wyze Webcam v2 is the Cinderella story of security cameras. Formerly, we didn't consider it to be a powerful security alternative (although we liked it as a family pet webcam ). It has since been enhanced and now matches our top choices due to the addition of a new cloud service, two-factor authentication for security, and a number of smart-home combination alternatives. We appreciate that the company continues to iterate and enhance an item that costs about as much as a pizza. However, the video quality isn't quite as good as on our other picks, it has a minimal field of vision, and Wyze states it prepares to do away with person detection, at least temporarily (more on that in a minute).</p>

<p>Unlike many other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ).

Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
