Furthermore, get live video to your phone when someone is on your front patio. Also, check on your animals and see what they do all day while you're at the office.</p>
<p>We had regularly enjoyable, useful interactions with Frontpoint's customer service, and were especially delighted about its easy DIY install After a grand total of half an hour, we were able to get our control panel connected and online, place our door sensors, and trigger the system. Our tester did hit a roadblock when his control board would not link, however a service rep attended to the issue immediately and new equipment arrived the next day.</p>
<p>Geofencing: This feature automates motion detection when you leave or return to a fixed area (usually your home). In this manner, you don't need to remember to switch off the camera's monitoring functions every time you come home. For this to work effectively, every user in the home (consisting of kids) would need the app installed and geofencing allowed on their phones. We also preferred models that let you disable the automatic Away option.</p>
