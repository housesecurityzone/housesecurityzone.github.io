<p>Now let's take a look at why consumer-grade cameras are often bad night vision performers. When a camera tries to see in the dark, it requires a source of light to light up the area listed below it.

This suggests they normally over-expose what is nearby in a scene, causing things and people to appear burnt out" and with no detail. A lot for trying to recognize the bad guys. Commercial cameras, however, frequently are geared up with more advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can adjust their brightness immediately to the scene. This function is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the subjects appear properly exposed and in full information. It has restricted usefulness if a camera can not catch and provide a properly-exposed and sharp  image throughout the day and at night.</p>
