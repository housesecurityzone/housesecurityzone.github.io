No-contract systems, which allow you to pay for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than dedicating to a long-term arrangement, are ending up being more typical. These systems sometimes cost more in advance for the hardware than pro systems that offer a discount in exchange for that lengthy service agreement.
