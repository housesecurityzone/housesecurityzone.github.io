<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a quick explanation of how thermal cameras work: All objects produce infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature.

A thermal camera consists of a heat sensor that can spotting small differences in temperature level. The device gathers the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and creates an electronic image based upon details about the temperature differences. Because items are rarely precisely the exact same temperature as other objects around them, a thermal camera can discover them, and they will appear as unique in a thermal image.</p>
