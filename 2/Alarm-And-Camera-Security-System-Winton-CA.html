The in advance cost of wireless security systems can be costly. Factor in the upfront cost of the control board, activation fees, monitoring charges and all equipment.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
