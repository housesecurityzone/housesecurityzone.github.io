The very first option, which might be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial service provider is unwilling or unavailable to offer those information) and document the topology and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other method is to rip and replace, performing a complete upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>

<p>In the evening, though it does not have the complete IR LED array of some competitors, the Arlo records enough light to see a good distance, and there's an adjustable spotlight available if you're putting it outdoors - which nicely brings us to the wonderful motion detection.
