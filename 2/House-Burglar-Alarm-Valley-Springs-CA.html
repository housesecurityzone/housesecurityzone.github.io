<p>Like any intrusive technology, the benefits of releasing public video cameras need to be stabilized versus the costs and threats. This innovation (a) has the prospective modification the core experience of going out in public in America because of its chilling result on people, (b) brings very genuine risks of abuse and "mission creep," and (c) would not considerably safeguard us versus terrorism. Given that, its advantages - preventing at most a few street criminal activities, and probably none - are disproportionately small.</p>
