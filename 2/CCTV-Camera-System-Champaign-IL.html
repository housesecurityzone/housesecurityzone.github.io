<h3>Home Security System Review in Illinois</h3>
<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. SimpliSafe reacted with a declaration stating the system would alert users when it discovered any kind of disturbance. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be a perfect storm of scenarios for someone to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing 2 various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units situated 6 to 26 feet far from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to replicate the issue. Although our testing shouldn't be taken as conclusive, our company believe this concern is unlikely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe customers who own the present system.</p>
<p>Do-it-yourself home security companies aren't like the ADTs and Vivints of the world.

Elements we considered consisted of the quality of the security cameras (do they have motion detection and night vision?), exists a monitoring plan, can window sensors and door sensing units be incorporated, whether the system had a mobile app, can it work with your door locks and can it be included into an existing smart home setup, including with voice commands by means of Amazon Alexa.</p>
<p>As a battery-operated innovation, wireless security systems need to be inspected occasionally to prevent system interruptions.

They're also susceptible to interference and service interruptions, just like WiFi signals and mobile phone connections, which can be disturbed and lost. Above is a basic summary of the uses, but alarms can benefit any location where security could be enhanced.</p>
<p>Nationwide Security Corporation has extensive experience with design, installation, service and monitoring of intrusion alarm systems in Connecticut and Rhode Island.
