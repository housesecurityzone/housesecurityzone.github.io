Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up room.

Rules are needed to establish a clear public understanding of such problems as whether video signals are tape-recorded, under what conditions, and for how long are they kept; what the criteria are for access to archived video by other government companies, or by the public; how the rules would be confirmed and implemented; and what punishments would use to violators.</p>
