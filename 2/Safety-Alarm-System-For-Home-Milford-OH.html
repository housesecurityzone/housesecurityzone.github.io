The first choice, which may be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial solution provider is not available or reluctant to supply those information) and record the geography and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system.

<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can interact with your home network wirelessly, which can be handy for installation.
