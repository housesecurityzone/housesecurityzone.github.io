<p>Frontpoint provides five packages and 2 monitoring strategies: Interactive and Ultimate. Our tester chose the Interactive plan but ended up disappointed with its lack of live video surveillance. When she got an alarm notification while on trip, she had no chance of evaluating whether her home had been broken into or if her cat had actually handled to journey the sensing unit. It turned out to be a false alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
<p>When we evaluated the Ring alarm equipment, it worked well. The door sensing units are a bit large, which can be bothersome for doors with molded or small frames. (To counteract this issue, Ring's released a slim magnet, which can be bought separately.) And the $199 five-piece package doesn't have adequate equipment to protect most homes totally.

CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal offense avoidance method, which argues that chances to offend can be minimized by altering a variety of systems such as increasing the risk of a wrongdoer being nabbed, increasing the effort to devote the criminal offense, reducing rewards from criminal activity commission, and decreasing justifications that trigger criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This implies that the offender should know the included surveillance for it to attain its desired result.</p>
