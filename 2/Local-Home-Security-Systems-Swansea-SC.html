Commercial cameras, however, often are geared up with advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can adjust their brightness automatically to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear appropriately exposed and in full information. If a camera can not catch and deliver a properly-exposed and sharp  image throughout the day and at night, it has limited usefulness.</p>
