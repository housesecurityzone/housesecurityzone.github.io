<p>Despite having an operating temperature level of -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 122 degrees Fahrenheit, the Circle 2 can be more difficult to install due to its minimal, 10-foot cable television and non-weatherproof plug. (You can secure that plug and include another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension package, or acquire a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This means the Circle 2 winds up being more costly total per unit than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof service. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not suggest it given that its battery-saving routines can interrupt performance.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing.
