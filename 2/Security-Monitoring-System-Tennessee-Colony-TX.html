It can be managed from another location through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile device or through the control board (also referred to as the alarm panel). A local system does not have the capacity to pair with other clever gadgets and can not be managed from another location. Also a local alarm will not contact the authorities; it merely sets off an audible siren to alert people close by.</p>
<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely suggest.</p>
