<h3>Home Alarm Security System in Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>D-Link has 4 cameras. The DCS-8000LH has no two-way audio, and the DCS-8010LH displayed bad images; the dcs-8525lh and the dcs-8300lh are plagued by a bad app and missing alerts. The Angee is low on functions and big on operating expenses. The Ooma Butterfleye has no night vision and has bad daytime video; the Reolink C1 Pro frequently showed green and pink lines throughout the screen; the Yi Dome Camera constantly flickered in the evening; and the Samsung SmartCam had bad audio and a complicated app.</p>
<p>Capable of running in both normal and badly lit environments, these cameras benefit from not needing inbuilt infrared illuminators as they can catch clear video images in the dark thanks to their additional delicate imaging chips. For this factor, these cameras are ideal for outdoor surveillance applications in which IR cameras are unable to operate optimally. Not just does Ring (now owned by Amazon) make video doorbells, it makes security cameras too: here we're selected the wireless, battery powered model, but there is a wired version too if you don't wish to worry about ever needing to recharge the batteries.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
