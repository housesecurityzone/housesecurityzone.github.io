Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I evaluated, consisting of creative things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit. However the Secure is costly, additional sensing units are costly, and the monitoring service-- which does not include smoke alarm or camera backups-- is also pricey if you don't dedicate to a three-year contract.</p>

We would suggest thinking about a Do It Yourself home security system instead if you desire to avoid having to sign a contract.</p>
