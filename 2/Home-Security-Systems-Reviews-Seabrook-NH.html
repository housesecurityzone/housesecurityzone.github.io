<p>A taut wire boundary security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to spot any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a basic mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to neglect objects that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to prevent this kind of attack.</p>
