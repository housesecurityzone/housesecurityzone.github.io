Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, including creative things like incorporating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensors into one system. However the Secure is pricey, extra sensing units are pricey, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't consist of smoke alarm or camera backups-- is also costly if you do not devote to a three-year agreement.</p>
