<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>

<p>Due to the restricted level of control (in comparison to onsite security management), it's essential to develop a detailed and clear  security framework.

Although it does not have the widest operating temperature level range (-4 degrees Fahrenheit to 104 degrees Fahrenheit), the Nest is among the couple of cameras on our list that featured a genuinely weatherproof cable and plug. That treatment makes the cable quite thick, so you can't actually run it through a window opening.</p>
<p>Last, we likewise consider how much it costs to see, share and conserve taped video.
