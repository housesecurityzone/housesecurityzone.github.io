With an expertly monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a property owner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
