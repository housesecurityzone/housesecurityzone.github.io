<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were excellent in our screening-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the picture quality based on offered bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day.

<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It requires an addition disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The photo quality is decent. The motion sensing units work well. I wouldn't recommend it though. People who are tech-savvy or pressed for time might prefer to install their own systems to prevent scheduling consultations and taking time off from work. Contacting a service technician costs more, but for those who prefer to let an expert deal with the job and do not mind investing the money, professional installation is the way to go.</p>

<p>The only real problem we have is with the cost.
