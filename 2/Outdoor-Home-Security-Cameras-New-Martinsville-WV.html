<p>Now let's analyze why consumer-grade cameras are frequently bad night vision performers. When a camera attempts to see in the dark, it requires a light to light up the location listed below it.

This suggests they typically over-expose what is nearby in a scene, triggering individuals and objects to appear burnt out" and with no detail. So much for trying to recognize the bad men. Commercial cameras, however, frequently are equipped with more advanced night vision infrared (IR) illuminators that can change their brightness instantly to the scene. This feature is called Smart IR", and it matches the camera's infrared light output to the scene. With Smart IR, the topics appear appropriately exposed and in full detail. If a camera can not catch and deliver a sharp and properly-exposed image throughout the day and at night, it has actually limited effectiveness.</p>
