Residence has updated that variation with 4G cellular backup and an onboard Z-Wave 500 Series chip, which supplies a better range for sensors. Both the original Abode system and the Residence Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, however the Iota is the only model we checked that also works with HomeKit. We have actually encountered a few technical problems while long-term testing the Residence Iota, and so will continue to test and upgrade appropriately. We no longer recommend it.</p>

It ended up being an incorrect alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>

Burglar alarm allows need a one-time registration cost of $45. There is no yearly renewal fee and the license stays in place as long as the alarm system remains in use at the exact same address.
