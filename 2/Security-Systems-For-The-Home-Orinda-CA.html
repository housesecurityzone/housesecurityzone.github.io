<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be used hardwired or totally wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our testing, must provide a minimum of a number of months of operation on a charge (depending on use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers 7 days of complimentary cloud storage (with more offered for a month-to-month fee ). Nevertheless, the camera will reset the sensor in between recordings, which Arlo states will enable the camera to correctly discover motion and not get stuck taping on a loop.
