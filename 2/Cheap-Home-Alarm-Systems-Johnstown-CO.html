<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a satisfaction to utilize too (a lot better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you want to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a learning curve. For even more basic smarts, it's fantastic, though. If you do not already have an Arlo camera or two in location, you're going to need to install a center that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can imply there are variety problems.</p>
