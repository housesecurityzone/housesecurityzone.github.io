<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids consulting with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively common. If a house owner forgets their keys and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by an area cat, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. False alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a property owner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Rather, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>
<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare individuals and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
