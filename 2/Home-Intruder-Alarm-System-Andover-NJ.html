<p>Most security cameras can be used both inside your home and outdoors. They generally have the very same features like night vision or remote watching, but they vary in resilience. Outdoor cameras must be weather condition resistant and sometimes, entirely waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance score are the most long lasting. Due to the fact that their design allows for minimum glare, bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor alternatives. In regards to detection, it is much better to have a camera equipped with infrared detection as opposed to motion detection. Because frequently times the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will provide more precise and less frequent informs.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
