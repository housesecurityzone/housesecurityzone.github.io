<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
