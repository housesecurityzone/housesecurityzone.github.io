<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>

This is also referred to as the rational option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance technique, which argues that opportunities to anger can be lowered by altering a variety of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of a culprit being nabbed, increasing the effort to commit the criminal activity, decreasing benefits from criminal offense commission, and decreasing provocations that trigger criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).
