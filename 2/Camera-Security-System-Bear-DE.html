<p>While every house owner worries about break-ins, uncertainty has surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high costs, complicated agreements with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces frequently leading to false alarms. Nearly all wireless home security systems use a cellular connection; for that reason, if your internet decreases or your power goes out, your security system will still work. Nevertheless, there are still some wireless home security systems that utilize a web connection as their primary communication source.
