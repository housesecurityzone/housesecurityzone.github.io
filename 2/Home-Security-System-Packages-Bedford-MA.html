<p>Firstly, it's tough to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, but it's better than a lot of cameras that are 4 times the rate. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after practically 2 years of usage, night and day images have actually always been clear, and we never ever had problems with the camera missing out on motion, a problem we came across when checking the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent a motion alert, Wyze has a clever feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It creates a green, on-screen box around the motion discovered. We've seen it highlight vehicles, mice, and moths.</p>
