<h3>Security House System in Clayton CA</h3>
<p>I discussed that all we would require to do is use any among the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient pushes the emergency situation button, it sends double informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the danger and, if required, might just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>

Here is what this indicates, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image throughout a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
