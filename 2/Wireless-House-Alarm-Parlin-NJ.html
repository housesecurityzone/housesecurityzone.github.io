<p>Camera, or closed-circuit tv (CCTV), are ending up being a more and more prevalent feature of American life. Worries of terrorism and the accessibility of ever-cheaper cameras have accelerated the trend a lot more.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
