<p>The Nest Web cam IQ is among the most smart Wi-Fi cameras on the marketplace, bringing facial recognition, a 4K image sensing unit, and person tracking to the party. See listed below for the indoor version, but this outside version comes with IP65 weatherproofing: it'll remain recording whatever the British weather condition tosses at it, and can run in temperature levels from -40 ° C to 45 ° C.
