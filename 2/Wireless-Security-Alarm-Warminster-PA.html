<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.

The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
