Alarm system allows require a one-time registration cost of $45. There is no annual renewal charge and the authorization remains in location as long as the alarm system is in usage at the same address.

It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
