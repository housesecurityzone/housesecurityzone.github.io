<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine individuals the camera is spotting using face acknowledgment. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to determine those people and will send smartphone alerts with that details when they appear at your home.
