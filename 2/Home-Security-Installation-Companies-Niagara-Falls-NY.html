It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>
