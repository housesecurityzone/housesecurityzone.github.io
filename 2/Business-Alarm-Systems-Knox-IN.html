<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were excellent in our testing-- during the day and at night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the image quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which might change throughout the day. Nest includes the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>

Let that sink in for a moment ... these companies do not even utilize the kind of cameras they are offering to the public, and there is a good reason that.</p>
