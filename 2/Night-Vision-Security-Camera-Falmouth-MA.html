<p>There should be a clear view between wireless transceivers, so that each camera can see" the home building to transmit video. We tried each of the cameras in several places around our house, varying from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we tested each camera using an iOS device (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) as well as an Android smartphone (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie).

<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is an enjoyment to use also (a lot better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you want to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a knowing curve.
