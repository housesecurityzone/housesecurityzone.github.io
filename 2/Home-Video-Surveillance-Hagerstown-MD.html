<p>IP cameras are much higher resolution, permitting audio and video surveillance to be sent out over a network, with IP addresses designated to each camera. More technical in nature, IP camera systems will likely take more knowledge to setup, and generally cost more than analog cameras. All sensing units and detectors communicate with a control panel.
