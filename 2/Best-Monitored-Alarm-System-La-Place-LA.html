<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal given that the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the store.
