Once a zone has been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and sends the message through a telephone line.

<p>So far so normal. Things begin to get really interesting with the Nest's facial recognition system.

<p>Pick the very best digital IP camera for your needs, from high definition to multi-pixel, box or dome, wired or wireless, and fixed or pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) versions.
