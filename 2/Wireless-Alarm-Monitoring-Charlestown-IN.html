<h3>New Alarm Systems For Homes Charlestown IN 47111</h3>
<p>A tight wire perimeter security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires normally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to neglect things that put in small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is installed to avoid this type of attack.</p>
