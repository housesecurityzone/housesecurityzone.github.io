<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise nice metal building and construction.
