Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.
