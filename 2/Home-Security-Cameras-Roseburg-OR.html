<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: If you want the best of whatever, you'll want Vivint. And if you're paying for a Vivint security system, it makes sense to get the wise home tech. Spring for the midlevel plan and get the automatic door lock and smart thermostat for the rate of equipment and $10 extra a month. We still like Vivint's basic package if you can't pay for the extra equipment. It consists of mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay extra for).</p>
<p>The system integrates a central base unit and six monitoring stations that send out alert signals to authorities, a keypad, entry sensors, and motion detectors for the most comprehensive protection available.
