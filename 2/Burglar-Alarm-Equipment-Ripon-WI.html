<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
