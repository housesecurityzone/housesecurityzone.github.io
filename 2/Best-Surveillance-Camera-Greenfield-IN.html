Yes, a video surveillance camera in public locations is good - it assists in crime-prevention and works as a deterrent.

<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you stroll by.
