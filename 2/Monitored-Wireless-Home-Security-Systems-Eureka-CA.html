If there are no as-built documents providing functionality and setup information to make this combination work, there are just 2 alternatives. The very first choice, which might be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial solution provider is unavailable or unwilling to offer those information) and record the geography and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system. The other approach is to rip and replace, carrying out a complete upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to converge them all.</p>

<p>Cross-zoning is a technique that does not need a new keypad. Using several sensing units to monitor activity in one area, software application analyses input from all the sources. For instance, if a motion detector trips in one location, the signal is recorded and the central-station monitor alerts the customer. A 2nd alarm signal-- gotten in a nearby zone within a short time-- is the confirmation the central-station monitor requires to request a dispatch right away.
