<p>While every house owner frets about break-ins, suspicion has surrounded home security systems due to their typically high costs, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often resulting in incorrect alarms.

<p>Nurse calling systems generally consist of emergency buttons or pull strings within the patient's restroom. If a patient is having difficulty, he can push the button or pull the string and it will send an alert to the nurse station. This is an easy switch that is usually open or normally closed. The majority of your commercial security cameras include dry contact input ports to incorporate alarms and alerts, sensors, gain access to control, and so on. My mind conceived an approach of not only providing the client with the patient-monitoring system but integrating it into their old-fashioned nurse call station system.</p>
<p>Some robberies and attacks occur at night. But the vast bulk take place throughout the day when no one is home. Some burglars break glass to reach in and unlock doors and windows.

<p>What many people do not realize is that there is another class of security camera that is directly offered to the general public, though not discovered in the big box and discount store. These surveillance cameras are categorized as "commercial-grade" security cameras and are the kind of camera used by these huge box chains to secure their stock. Take a look at the ceiling of customer electronics shops and warehouse chains and you will notice in each aisle a white dome camera that is larger than the typical customer camera. Let that sink in for a moment ... these companies do not even use the type of cameras they are selling to the general public, and there is a good reason.</p>
