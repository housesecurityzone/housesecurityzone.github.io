<p>so say you have a camera that someone can see it they would shoot it if they had a weapon so I advise to have actually cameras integrated in to a house that will be pertected by cameras.

<p>ASecureLife's suggestion: If you want the best of whatever, you'll want Vivint. And if you're spending for a Vivint security system, it makes sense to get the wise home tech. Spring for the midlevel plan and get the automatic door lock and wise thermostat for the rate of equipment and $10 extra a month. If you can't pay for the additional equipment, we still like Vivint's basic bundle. It includes mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay additional for).</p>
<p>This isn't the most inexpensive security system from Blue by ADT, but we believe it's worth it for the convenience and security that features a camera. The cops department asked the city board to resolve the problem relating to the quantity of police resources being used on false burglar alarms.

However what about outside the structure, or if the burglar has managed to discover their method? This is where motion sensing units come into play.</p>
