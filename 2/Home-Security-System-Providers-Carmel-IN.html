Figure 1-1 depicts an example of a CCTV installation that monitors select locations of protection. The first installation was developed and established for the different parking center. This execution included numerous set position cameras on each floor of the parking lot, stairwells, and exits, all linked straight to a main control unit (PCU) for management of each video stream.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
