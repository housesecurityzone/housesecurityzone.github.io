<h3>Security Camera Surveillance Raceland LA 70394</h3>
<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that suggests potential culprits are less likely to dedicate criminal activity if they believe they are being enjoyed or have a higher danger of being collared. This is also known as the rational choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal offense avoidance strategy, which argues that opportunities to offend can be decreased by altering a range of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of a transgressor being captured, increasing the effort to dedicate the criminal activity, decreasing rewards from criminal activity commission, and reducing justifications that generate criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This means that the offender needs to know the included surveillance for it to accomplish its desired impact.</p>
<p>The circuit and sensors alarm system are monitored by the control board - the computer system that arms the security system and finds breaks in the electric circuit. This control board has its own power supply, so the burglar can not cut off the power prior to breaching the border.
