Not excellent, not awful, however with a really simple setup procedure (and trust me, that truly is a killer function when it comes to clever cameras.) This more recent version is much the same, to be frank. With a digital video recorder DVR, you get clear audio and video and remote viewing, plus you can tape from all cameras at the same time.

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest).

We believe that's expensive.</p>
