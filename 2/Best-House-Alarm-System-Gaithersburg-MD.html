It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest).

<p>Not all security cameras work in the dark. Security cameras that have low-light capabilities have a shutter that enables more light to go into the camera's sensing unit. The more light that is permitted to get in the camera the brighter the image will be. However, even these low light capable cameras have digital noise that make the dark image look fuzzy. To combat this fuzzy image some security cameras come geared up with 2D and 3D digital sound reduction Some security cameras now come with infrared light that is unnoticeable to the human eye but can be picked up by a security camera's sensor.</p>
