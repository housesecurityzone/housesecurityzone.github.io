The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
