While the 4th Amendment to the US Constitution uses some protection against video searches carried out by the police, there are currently no general, lawfully enforceable rules to limit personal privacy intrusions and protect against abuse of CCTV systems. Rules are needed to develop a clear public understanding of such concerns as whether video signals are taped, under what conditions, and the length of time are they kept; what the requirements are for access to archived video by other federal government agencies, or by the public; how the rules would be confirmed and implemented; and what penalties would use to lawbreakers.</p>

<p>Mix of Man and Maker: People ought to be out on the work-places and streets attempting to avoid criminal activity or losses. CCTV cameras are just a less reliable alternative to having authorities stroll the streets or security workers on patrolling and physical surveillance.
