<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
<p>The night vision on this camera is praised time and once again in customer reviews, and it delivers a crisp image approximately 32 feet. And despite the fact that the app and software are easy to deal with, it's a little bit of a disappointment that you can't incorporate this camera with any wise home hubs or gizmos. A lot of smart cameras can be set to do things like this, but few make things as simple as Hive have actually done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is supposed to make our lives simpler and Hive's community measures up to that. It's all the function with no disappointment.</p>
