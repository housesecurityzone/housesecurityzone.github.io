<p>Security: There have been lots of headings about hackers jeopardizing home cameras, infant screens, and other Wi-Fi gadgets to spy on individuals, so make certain to check what steps has each maker taken to remove this issue. Search for a camera that supports updated wireless security procedures, such as WPA2, and make certain it encrypts web transmission of your user name, your password, and the live feeds. Never ever install a security camera (or a router or any other gadget on your home network) without changing its default user ID and password.</p>
