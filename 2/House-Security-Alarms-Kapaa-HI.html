When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those people and will send smartphone alerts with that info when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate expected visitors from random strangers.
