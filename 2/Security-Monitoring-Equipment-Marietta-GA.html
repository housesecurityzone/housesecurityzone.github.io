<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a harmful assailant, considering that the disturbance of the network prevents the circulation of data and actually indirectly secures data by avoiding it from being sent. The normal reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the preliminary handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, supplying a chance for the harmful attacker to tape-record these codes and utilize different cracking tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to acquire unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools offered which can introduce a dictionary design attack of "potentially accepted" security secrets based on the "design" security key captured throughout the network healing.</p>
