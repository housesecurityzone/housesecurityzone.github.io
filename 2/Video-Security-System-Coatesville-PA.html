<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>

This isn't the most affordable SimpliSafe package, but we think the addition of smoke protection is a plus worth spending for.</p>
