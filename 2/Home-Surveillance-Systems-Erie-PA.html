<p>Another recurring problem is the cancelation process, as with any company that requires you to sign a contract. However, most clients that don't need to go through cancelation are rather delighted with the customer care.

<p>Residence also uses a Smart Security Package that includes just one entry sensor and one motion detector. Since that limits the variety of entrances you can guard, we think Residence works best for smaller sized spaces like an apartment or dormitory. It's possible to add motion sensors for about $30 each, but that can rapidly add up if you need to buy more than a couple of. Just get the bonus you require. Be absolutely sure you can afford it if you're going to buy something on top of a company's basic home security packages.
