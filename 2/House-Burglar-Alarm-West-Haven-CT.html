Lots of recent outdoor Wi-Fi cameras use support for IFTTT (If This Then That), an internet service that utilizes small programs (applets) that you produce to have the camera connect with other IFTTT-enabled devices.

<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big quantity of information required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, however not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for more electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera separately, typically via 110VAC power.</p>
<p>A wireless home security system utilizes a radio frequency to interact with the control board and sensors. The control board then interacts with a monitoring center using a cellular signal.

The Nest Webcam Outdoor uses a separate install, instead of an incorporated one, so you're not restricted to viewing one location. The install is magnetic, but it's strong, so you can easily attach the camera and move it up, down, and all over in between.</p>
