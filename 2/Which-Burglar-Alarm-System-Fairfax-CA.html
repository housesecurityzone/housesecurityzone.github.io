<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be utilized hardwired or completely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a detachable, rechargeable battery that, based on our screening, should supply at least a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending on use). The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers seven days of complimentary cloud storage (with more readily available for a regular monthly charge ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will permit the camera to properly find motion and not get stuck recording on a loop. That also saves battery life, but it might leave you with tape-recording spaces during essential security events. If home security is your primary issue, we 'd advise among our top picks, but the Arlo is fantastic for signing in on household and pets-- or stray cats slipping around your yard.</p>
