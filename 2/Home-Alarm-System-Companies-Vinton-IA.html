<p>Carbon monoxide detection. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that can be toxic to both animals and humans. Because carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless, the only method to monitor hazardous levels of this gas is with a carbon monoxide gas detector.

<p>All of the self-installed systems I tested can operate without a monitoring plan, but then they are limited to just sounding an alarm inside your home and sometimes, pressing a notification to your phone and do not have the ability to automatically dispatch authorities or emergency situation workers.
