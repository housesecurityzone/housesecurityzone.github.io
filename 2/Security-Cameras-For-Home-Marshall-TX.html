<p>DISCLAIMER: We bought the iSmart camera, Piper, SimpliSafe, Scout, Ring Alarm, Nest Secure, and everything SmartThings on our own, but the iSmartAlarm system, home system, and Arlo cameras were provided to us for screening.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.
