<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively typical.

With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be contacted by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. False alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner will not get calls from a monitoring company. Instead, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
<p>Cross-zoning is a technique that does not require a new keypad. Utilizing numerous sensing units to monitor activity in one location, software application analyses input from all the sources. For example, if a motion detector trips in one location, the signal is recorded and the central-station monitor notifies the consumer. A second alarm signal-- received in an adjacent zone within a short time-- is the confirmation the central-station monitor requires to request a dispatch immediately. This builds in increased protection and a stop working safe must a door blow open or a bird rattle an exterior window.</p>
