If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly starts another, with no gaps in between. Recordings are easy to find under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the restricted cloud recording and microSD recording, however we do not suggest that for home security because if it's taken, you do not have a backup.</p>
