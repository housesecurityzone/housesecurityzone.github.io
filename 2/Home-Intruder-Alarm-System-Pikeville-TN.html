<h2>Home Monitoring & Alarm Response Pikeville</h2>

<p>Arlo claims that you should be able to get 4 to 6 months out of a totally charged battery, depending on settings, usage, and surrounding temperature level. In long-term testing of the camera, we usually got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic location. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have actually not tested. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that varied between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still running at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-lasting screening, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained the camera down to the point where it required a complete charge once a month.</p>
