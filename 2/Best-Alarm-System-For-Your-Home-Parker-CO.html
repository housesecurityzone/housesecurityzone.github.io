<p>When the level of carbon monoxide in your home reaches an unsafe level, a carbon monoxide detector activates. Unlike other ecological risks, you can not see, taste, or smell carbon monoxide. These detectors can conserve your life and those of your family pets. Carbon monoxide is launched when you burn fuel, wood, oil, charcoal, propane, and gas, so homes with gas home appliances, chimneys, wood-burning ranges, and linked garages have a higher requirement for carbon monoxide gas detectors. Like smoke and fire alarms, these sensors can work as stand-alone alarms or get in touch with your security system.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
