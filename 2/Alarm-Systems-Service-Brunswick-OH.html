The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies every time you walk by.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
