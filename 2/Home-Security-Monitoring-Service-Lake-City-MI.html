<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
