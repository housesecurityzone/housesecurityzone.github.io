<p>At night, though it does not have the complete IR LED variety of some rivals, the Arlo records enough light to see a good distance, and there's an adjustable spotlight offered if you're positioning it outdoors - which neatly brings us to the wonderful motion detection. Not only is the Arlo fast to pick out moving items, it's brainy enough to make a decent stab at working out exactly what it's taking a look at. Simply a couple decades earlier, the home security industry was dominated by a few huge names using expensive, rigid strategies with little flexibility and hostile, long-term agreements. Systems were limited to a couple wired motion sensing units connected to a keypad control board and go through a landline. Nowadays, this has actually all changed.</p>

If you don't currently have an Arlo camera or two in place, you're going to need to install a center that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the hub (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can imply there are range problems.</p>
