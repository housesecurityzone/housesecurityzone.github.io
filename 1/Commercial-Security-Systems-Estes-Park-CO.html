<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
