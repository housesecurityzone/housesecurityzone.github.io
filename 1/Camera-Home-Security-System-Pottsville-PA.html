<p>Arlo declares that you should be able to get four to six months out of a completely charged battery, depending on settings, usage, and surrounding temperature. In long-term testing of the camera, we usually got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic area. If you're stressed over charging, Arlo sells a photovoltaic panel, which we have not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature level variety is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that varied between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent.
