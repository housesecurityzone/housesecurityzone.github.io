Figure 1-1 illustrates an example of a CCTV installation that keeps track of select areas of protection. The first installation was designed and established for the separate parking center. This execution consisted of numerous set position cameras on each flooring of the parking lot, stairwells, and exits, all linked directly to a main control system (PCU) for management of each video stream. The PCU is a basic gadget for managing the input and output of video feeds through the coax cable televisions.

<p>You will have complete Pan-Tilt-Zoom control of your camera and the video will be digitally tape-recorded for access anywhere.

<h2>Home Surveillance Cameras Inside The Home Munster</h2>
