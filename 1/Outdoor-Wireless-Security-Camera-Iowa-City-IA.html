<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular considering that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level.
