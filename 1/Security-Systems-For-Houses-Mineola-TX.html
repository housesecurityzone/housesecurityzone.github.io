CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a great security camera and an incredible value. It gets an Exceptional score for video quality and is much easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of totally free storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to save video footage locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid membership plans for extra cloud storage.
