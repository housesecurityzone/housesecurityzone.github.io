<p>Wired: Each camera is linked to a recording unit, which in turn is connected to a router. Installation can be complicated - specifically if your home has actually already been developed - so make sure to speak with a professional before handling the task yourself. Wired home security cameras send data through a closed circuit, not over a signal. They're also not vulnerable to disturbance such as cellular and radio frequencies.
