<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
<p>The night vision on this camera is applauded time and again in client reviews, and it delivers a crisp photo as much as 32 feet. And even though the app and software are easy to deal with, it's a little a disappointment that you can't integrate this camera with any smart home hubs or gadgets. A great deal of smart cameras can be programmed to do things like this, but couple of make things as easy as Hive have actually done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is supposed to make our lives simpler and Hive's environment measures up to that. It's all the function with no aggravation.</p>
