Here is what this indicates, by way of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for more electrical wiring.

However, to conserve that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a gap of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Also, the Blink doesn't give you geofencing or two-way interaction, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker locations.
