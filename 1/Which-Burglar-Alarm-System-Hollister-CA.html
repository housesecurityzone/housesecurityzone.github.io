When it found any type of interference, SimpliSafe responded with a statement stating the system would signal users. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be an ideal storm of situations for somebody to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were not able to replicate the concern. Although our testing should not be taken as definitive, we believe this concern is unlikely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe consumers who own the existing system.</p>
