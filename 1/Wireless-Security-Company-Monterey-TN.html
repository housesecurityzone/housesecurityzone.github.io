Some popular cameras instantly override ended videos, which might not be most perfect if you require to keep a video.

<p>The NVR removes these problems, since it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll require to know whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder before purchasing.</p>
