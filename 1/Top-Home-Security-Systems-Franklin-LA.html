<p>This isn't the most affordable security system from Blue by ADT, but we think it's worth it for the convenience and security that comes with a camera.

The regulation was modified and entered into effect on June 1, 2013.

<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
