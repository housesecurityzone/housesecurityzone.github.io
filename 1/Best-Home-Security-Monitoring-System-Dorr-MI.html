Throughout testing, we had two Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that changed in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-lasting testing, we put the camera in a business car park that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera down to the point where it required a complete charge once a month.</p>

If there are three select emergency exits, panic alarms, or door sensors, a single fixed camera can just see one. This produces a one in 3 possibility of catching a specific incident on video (either live or recorded). The command center also consisted of a computer system designated for submitting incident reports online. These can be accessed by management workers at a later date from a database by means of the computer system network.</p>
