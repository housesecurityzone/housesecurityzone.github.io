<p>It's becoming more popular. But for the time being, if you see an outdoor camera that offers two-way audio, go for it.

This also depends on the provider, however you can anticipate signing a contract with service providers who require expert installation of their systems. The typical length of a home security contract is 36 months or 3 years. On the greater end, some contracts could cover as much as 60 months or 5 years. If you wish to avoid having to sign an agreement, we would advise considering a Do It Yourself home security system rather.</p>
