Rules are needed to develop a clear public understanding of such issues as whether video signals are tape-recorded, under what conditions, and how long are they retained; what the criteria are for access to archived video by other government agencies, or by the public; how the rules would be verified and imposed; and what penalties would apply to violators.</p>
