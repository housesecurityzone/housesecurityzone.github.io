<p>A tight wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires typically mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to discover any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to neglect objects that put in percentages of pressure on the wires. This type of system is susceptible to burglars digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to avoid this type of attack.</p>
