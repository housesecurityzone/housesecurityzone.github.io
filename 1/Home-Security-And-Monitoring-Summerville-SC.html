These systems often cost more in advance for the hardware than professional systems that offer a discount in exchange for that lengthy service agreement. Spending for the equipment up front supplies you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can stop the monitoring and begin service as often times as you desire.</p>
