<p>The genuine reason cameras are usually released is to decrease much pettier crimes. But it has actually not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been thoroughly deployed in public places, sociologists studying the problem have found that they have not lowered criminal activity. "When the criminal activity and offence figures were adjusted to take account of the general downward pattern in crimes and offences," criminologists discovered in one research study, "reductions were noted in specific categories but there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had actually decreased crime in general in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Home Office also found that cameras did not cut criminal activity or the fear of crime (as had a 2002 research study, likewise for the British federal government).</p>

Numerous insurance companies use discount rates on insurance premiums to customers with operable alarm systems. These discount rates may be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous authorities departments provide a number of "free" false alarms before enforcing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to react is significant right from the start. The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurance companies cast doubt on the appropriateness of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of allowing three or four totally free false alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they offer no up-front incentives to encourage owners to prevent incorrect alarms.</p>
