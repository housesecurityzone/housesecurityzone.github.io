PTZ cameras are from another location controlled, and allow the operator to pan (move left or right), tilt up and or down, or zoom better or further away in order to follow individuals as they move.

This technology (a) has the prospective modification the core experience of going out in public in America since of its chilling effect on residents, (b) brings really genuine threats of abuse and "objective creep," and (c) would not substantially protect us versus terrorism. Given that, its benefits - avoiding at the majority of a couple of street criminal activities, and most likely none - are disproportionately small.</p>
