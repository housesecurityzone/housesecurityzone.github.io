<p>I" m not satisfied with this item. It needs an addition hard drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is decent. The motion sensors work well. I wouldn't suggest it though. People who are tech-savvy or pushed for time might choose to install their own systems to prevent scheduling visits and requiring time off from work.

<p>We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
