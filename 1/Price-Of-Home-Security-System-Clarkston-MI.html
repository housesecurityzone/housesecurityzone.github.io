<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
