We still like Vivint's basic bundle if you can't manage the extra equipment. It consists of mobile access to your system (something some companies make you pay extra for).</p>
<p>That caveat aside, the benefit with alarm systems like these is that experts will concern your place to install whatever for you, and you can typically expect a higher level of hands-on tech support and customer care if you ever wish to make changes to your setup, too.
