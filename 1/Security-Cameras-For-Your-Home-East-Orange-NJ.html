<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>

Hi there Rebeca, thanks for this blog. I am so delighted that you have pointed out about clever home integration Simply last week I was given lot of cameras to install by a homeowner, sadly the owner did not buy cameras compatible with his home automation systems. So we had to purchase new cameras.</p>
<p>Power-over-Ethernet switches apply only to NVR systems, however they eliminated other parts that would be needed for a DVR system, like additional power sources and the BNC cables used to connect cameras to the DVR. Rather, when you connect a PoE switch to your network, you've got a power source and a way of sending information to your NVR all in one package. The biggest factor to consider when choosing which type of PoE switch to buy is the number of cameras that will be on your system. The next factor to consider is how most likely you are to scale up in the future.</p>
<p>You can utilize a wireless connection to run your SimpliSafe system, but it does not support Z-Wave, Zigbee, or IFTTT, implying you won't be able to link it directly to other third-party devices like clever locks or automate specific actions in the home. You can, nevertheless, use Alexa to equip or disarm the SimpliSafe system and connect it to your Nest Thermostat to save energy based upon when you're home or away. However these integrations aren't rather as robust as the home or Ring systems.</p>
