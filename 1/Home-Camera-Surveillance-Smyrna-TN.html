I called their customer care group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to discuss it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the lump sum, due to the fact that apparently they automobile restore you at some time unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a composed not by mail.
