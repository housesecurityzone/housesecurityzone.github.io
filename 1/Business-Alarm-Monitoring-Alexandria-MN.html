<p>We searched for DIY systems that offered expert monitoring, both with and without a contract. Although some companies offer complimentary or greatly discounted hardware in exchange for a service commitment that can last anywhere from one to five years, we discovered no-contract systems to be the most flexible. Some individuals may want to register for service only for when they or their partner runs out town, for example. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and allow you to be in overall control of the equipment you use, along with how and when you use and pay for monitoring services.</p>
