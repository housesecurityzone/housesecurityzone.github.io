<p>I have this camera linked to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk intending into my corridor. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which had the ability to discover the camera without trouble. The IR lights at night are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the cost and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
