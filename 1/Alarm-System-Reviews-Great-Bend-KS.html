<p>Arlo claims that you should have the ability to get four to 6 months out of a fully charged battery, depending upon settings, use, and surrounding temperature. In long-term screening of the camera, we usually got half that, unless the camera was facing a low-traffic area. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have actually not checked. The Arlo's operating temperature level range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. During testing, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperature levels that fluctuated between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one complete month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a hectic street was standing strong at 60 percent. During long-term screening, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good amount of weekly traffic.
