<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It needs an addition hard disk drive for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is good. The motion sensors work well. I wouldn't recommend it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pushed for time might prefer to install their own systems to prevent scheduling appointments and taking some time off from work. Employing a professional costs more, but for those who prefer to let an expert handle the job and do not mind spending the additional money, professional installation is the method to go.</p>
