As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical considering that the doorway and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
