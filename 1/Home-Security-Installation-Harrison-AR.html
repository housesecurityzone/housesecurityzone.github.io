<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
