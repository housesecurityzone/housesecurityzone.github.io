<p>As an incentive to buy an alarm, a number of companies provide "complimentary monitoring services" for the first few months. Numerous insurance companies offer discounts on insurance coverage premiums to clients with operable alarm systems. These discounts might be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, lots of authorities departments provide a number of "free" false alarms before imposing any fine, although the cost to respond is significant right from the start. The deals of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance companies bring into question the appropriateness of the present pattern in U.S. policing of allowing 3 or four free incorrect alarms per fiscal year, due to the fact that they provide no up-front rewards to motivate owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
<p>Wireless security cameras being checked in a Customer Reports lab. If you do experience a home intrusion emergency situation, you can trigger the 80dB alarm.
