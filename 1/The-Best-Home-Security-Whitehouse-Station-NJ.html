Guidelines are needed to establish a clear public understanding of such concerns as whether video signals are recorded, under what conditions, and for how long are they kept; what the requirements are for access to archived video by other federal government firms, or by the public; how the rules would be verified and implemented; and what punishments would apply to lawbreakers.</p>
