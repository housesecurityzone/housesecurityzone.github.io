<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm system, a number of companies use "complimentary monitoring services" for the very first few months. Many insurance companies provide discounts on insurance coverage premiums to consumers with operable alarm systems. These discounts might be as much as 20 percent for commercial consumers, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, lots of police departments use several "complimentary" incorrect alarms before enforcing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to react is considerable right from the start. The deals of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance providers cast doubt on the suitability of the existing trend in U.S. policing of allowing three or four complimentary false alarms per calendar year, because they supply no up-front rewards to motivate owners to prevent false alarms.</p>
