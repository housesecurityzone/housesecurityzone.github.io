<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
