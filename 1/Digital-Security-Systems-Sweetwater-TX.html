So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smart device notifications and live views were painfully sluggish, and the variety is poor. Also, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>
