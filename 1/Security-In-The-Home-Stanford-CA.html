<p>The NVR removes these problems, because it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, typically by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll require to understand whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder before purchasing.</p>
