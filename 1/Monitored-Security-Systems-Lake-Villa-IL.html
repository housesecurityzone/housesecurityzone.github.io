The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
