<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on 2 AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of totally free cloud storage, and it captures a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone notifications and live views were painfully slow, and the variety is bad.
