<p>Frontpoint's outdoor cameras are the most cost effective in terms of both equipment cost and month-to-month monitoring fees.

<p>Bullet cameras are among the two most typical CCTV camera types. They have a long cylindrical shape, providing their name and an unique look. This look is identifiable to almost everybody and therefore serves as a deterrent to undesirable people. If security cameras show up, the hope is intruders and wrongdoers go somewhere else instead. That being said, bullet cameras are more prone to vandalism due to the fact that of their obvious look. Additionally, the shape of the camera is perfect for concentrating on a fixed field, such as an entry or exit, but needs multiple cameras if a user needs to see several fixed views. Bullet cameras are easily mountable and can work indoors or outdoors. They feature a small lip on completion of the camera that includes weather condition protection and decreases glare.</p>
<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare individuals and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
