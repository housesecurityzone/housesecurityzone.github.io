<p>I" m not satisfied with this product. It needs an addition hard disk for storage and a cd disk to program in order to record. The image quality is decent. The motion sensing units work well. I wouldn't recommend it though. Individuals who are tech-savvy or pressed for time may choose to install their own systems to prevent scheduling consultations and requiring time off from work.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
