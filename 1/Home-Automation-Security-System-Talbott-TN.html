<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching.

Also, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system.
