<p>The NVR removes these problems, due to the fact that it is rather linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send footage to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
