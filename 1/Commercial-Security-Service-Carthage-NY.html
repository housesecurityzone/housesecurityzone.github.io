<h3>Smart Home Security System in New York</h3>
<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a malicious assailant, considering that the interruption of the network avoids the flow of data and actually indirectly protects data by avoiding it from being transferred. The normal factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, offering a chance for the malicious attacker to tape-record these codes and use different cracking tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools available which can release a dictionary style attack of "potentially accepted" security keys based upon the "model" security key caught during the network healing.</p>
