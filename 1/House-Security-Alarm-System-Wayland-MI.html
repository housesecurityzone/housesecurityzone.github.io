<p>If you do not need a Fort Knox-level of security but do desire an attractive camera for monitoring family pets and family members that can also alert you to felons, then the Hive View works truly well. Wi-Fi cameras aren't simply for recording a thief in the act, though. They're also beneficial for casual home monitoring. Put on tables, racks, and counter tops, they allow you to watch on what your animals are doing, know when the kids come home from school, or find who's been hitting the alcohol cabinet. The majority of even permit you to interact with whoever is on-camera as the action is occurring, by means of an ingrained microphone and speaker.</p>
