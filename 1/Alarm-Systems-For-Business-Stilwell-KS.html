You hear a small chirping sound whenever the entry sensing units get triggered when you position the device on Standby mode. In Home mode, a loud 93dB alarm is triggered whenever the entry sensing units are activated. Finally, in Away mode, both the motion sensing units and entry sensors are active.

As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has actually pointed out, "knowing that you are being seen by armed government agents tends to put a damper on things. You do not want to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "people might find out to be mindful about the periodicals and books they read in public, preventing titles that may alarm unseen observers.
