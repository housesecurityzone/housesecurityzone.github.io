<p>Our alarm systems might be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to recognize an offense. When a zone has been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped.
