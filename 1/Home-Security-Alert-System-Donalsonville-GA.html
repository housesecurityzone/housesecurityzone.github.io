<p>A tight wire boundary security system is generally an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are developed to find any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a range of switches or detectors that pick up movement at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensors to overlook objects that exert percentages of pressure on the wires.

The control unit generally has a separate channel or zone for burglar and fire sensing units, and better systems have a separate zone for every different sensor, in addition to internal difficulty indications (mains power loss, low battery, damaged wire, etc.).</p>
