When people are being enjoyed by the authorities - or aware they may be watched at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "knowing that you are being seen by armed government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You don't wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he alerts, "individuals might learn to be mindful about the books and regulars they check out in public, avoiding titles that may alarm hidden observers.

<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our screening-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video.

Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
