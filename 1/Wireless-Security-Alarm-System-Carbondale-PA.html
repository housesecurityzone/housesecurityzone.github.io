<p>A dome CCTV camera gets its name from the dome-shaped casing that the camera beings in. Whilst these are reasonably discreet CCTV cameras in appearance, this does not stop them from preventing criminals.

<p>The cost of admission for the Deep Guard Home Security system isn't that high, even at $499, due to the fact that it includes three outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds expensive, but it's not so much when you think about that a live person is seeing a live feed whenever the cameras discover suspicious activity. That person at Deep Guard's facility can warn a suspicious individual that they're being observed, and they can call your local police dispatcher if they decline to leave or engage in a criminal act. It's not for everyone, but it's the best DIY outdoor security camera we have actually seen to date.</p>
