(You can safeguard that plug and add another 15 feet of cable television with the $30 extension package, or buy a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This suggests the Circle 2 ends up being more expensive general per unit than the Nest camera if you desire a weatherproof service. Logitech does make a cordless variation of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it because its battery-saving routines can interrupt performance.</p>
