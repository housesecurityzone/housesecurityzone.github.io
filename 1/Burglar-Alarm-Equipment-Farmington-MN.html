<p>Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first concern you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The answer depends upon a couple of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you plan to save and the length of time you plan to keep recorded video. The video footage is going to consume up storage space quickly if there are numerous cameras shooting in a greater resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the oldest footage once you reach the system's capacity, however if you're not careful, the system may overwrite archived footage that you still require.</p>
