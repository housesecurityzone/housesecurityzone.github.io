<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
<h2>Home Security Monitoring Systems Center</h2>
<p>In a current New york city Times article about Chicago's 911 broadening digital video surveillance system, Albert Alschuler, a law teacher at Northwestern University, makes the point that public camera systems do not break any privacy concerns due to the fact that they are set up in public areas. They have been executed for public safety and criminal activity prevention and are not for the exploitation of individuals. A private with a camcorder, or the paparazzi, may have a more self-satisfying agenda and thanks to digital technology and the Internet can break privacy laws with much more destructive consequences than video surveillance cameras, which are kept secured and in stringent self-confidence.</p>
<p>Forecasting and Post-Event Investigations: The usefulness of surveillance innovation in preventing and solving criminal activities depends on the resources put into it.

However, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second spaces in between clips. Protective Systems uses a touch-screen control board and keypads, various sensors (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide gas, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.
