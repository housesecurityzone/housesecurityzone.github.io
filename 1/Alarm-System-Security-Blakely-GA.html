<h2>Home Security Alarm System & Burglary Prevention Blakely</h2>
<p>In a current New York Times short article about Chicago's 911 expanding digital video surveillance system, Albert Alschuler, a law teacher at Northwestern University, makes the point that public camera systems do not violate any personal privacy concerns since they are set up in public places. They have actually been implemented for public safety and crime prevention and are not for the exploitation of individuals. An individual with a camcorder, or the paparazzi, might have a more self-satisfying agenda and thanks to digital technology and the Web can breach privacy laws with much more devastating effects than video surveillance cameras, which are kept secured and in stringent self-confidence.</p>

With many self-monitored systems, house owners spend for the equipment upfront and own it. Period.</p>
