Tenants like Brinks wireless security systems now with a range of home automation features. What to consider: Rates start at $19.95 a month for monitoring, but increase to $59.95 a month if you want additional features like mobile control monitoring or a security camera bundle to accompany your system.

<p>Throughout our screening, this compact camera recorded sharp, 1080p HD images day and night, and its digital zoom was useful for taking a more detailed look. We specifically like this camera's broad, 180-degree field of vision, because you're less likely to get a blind area anywhere you set it up. World Wide Security provides professional monitoring in Nassau and Suffolk counties (New York). The company needs a 5-year contract. You can install any of these security systems yourself, but some need that you pay a regular monthly charge for professional monitoring.</p>
<p>Systems that can interact in one style or another are video surveillance, access control, fire systems, elevator systems, intrusion detection, photo imaging, and structure automation.

If you're taking a look at a local security company, there's a likelihood it contracts out monitoring to Brinks. Even some huge companies like Nest utilize it.</p>
