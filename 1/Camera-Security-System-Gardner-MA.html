IP cameras that are connected to the same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send video to the NVR.

In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will work with a provided video recorder prior to purchasing.</p>
