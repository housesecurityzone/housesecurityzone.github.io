<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm system, a variety of companies use "complimentary monitoring services" for the very first few months. Lots of insurer offer discount rates on insurance coverage premiums to clients with operable alarm. These discount rates might be as much as 20 percent for commercial customers, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous cops departments use several "complimentary" false alarms before imposing any fine, although the cost to respond is considerable right from the start.
