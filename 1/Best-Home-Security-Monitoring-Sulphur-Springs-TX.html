<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a fantastic security camera and a phenomenal value. It receives an Outstanding rating for video quality and is much easier to utilize than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of complimentary storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store video locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not provide paid subscription plans for additional cloud storage.

Without an sd or the service card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
