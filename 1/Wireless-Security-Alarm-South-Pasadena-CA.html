Hey there Rebeca, thanks for this blog.

<p>In its truest form, a CCTV camera is an analog camera that transfers signals through coax cable to a single central location for recording, monitoring, and video analysis. While the recent pattern is a push towards IP network cameras, CCTV cameras are still commonly used, and use a cost-effective answer to many common surveillance circumstances. When doors and windows open, be the very first to know. Connect all your Ring Alarm parts and pair them to your mobile phones with the Ring Base Station.</p>
<p>Not all security cameras operate in the dark. Security cameras that have low-light capabilities have a shutter that enables more light to get in the camera's sensing unit. The more light that is enabled to enter the camera the brighter the image will be. Nevertheless, even these low light capable cameras have digital sound that make the dark image look fuzzy. To fight this fuzzy image some security cameras come equipped with 2D and 3D digital noise reduction Some security cameras now include infrared light that is undetectable to the human eye but can be picked up by a security camera's sensor.</p>
