<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker.
