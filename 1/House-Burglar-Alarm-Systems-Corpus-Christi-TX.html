<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
