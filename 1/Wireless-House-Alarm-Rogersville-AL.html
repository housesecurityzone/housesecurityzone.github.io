<p>Most importantly, it's tough to dislike the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other picks, but it's better than a great deal of cameras that are four times the price.

When utilized in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals every time you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
