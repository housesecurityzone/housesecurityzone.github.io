<p>First and foremost, it's hard to hate the image coming out of this $20 camera. It's not as sharp as our other choices, however it's better than a lot of cameras that are 4 times the price. The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180).

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks totally normal considering that the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when clients understand that the economical consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
