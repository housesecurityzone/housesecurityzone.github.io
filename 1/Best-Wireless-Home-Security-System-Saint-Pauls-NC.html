<p>Arlo claims that you ought to have the ability to get 4 to 6 months out of a fully charged battery, depending on settings, use, and surrounding temperature level. In long-lasting screening of the camera, we normally got half that, unless the camera was dealing with a low-traffic area. If you're fretted about charging, Arlo sells a solar panel, which we have not evaluated. The Arlo's operating temperature range is -4 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. Throughout screening, we had 2 Arlo Pro cameras set up outside in temperatures that changed in between 30 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 degrees Fahrenheit. After one full month, the camera that saw less action was still performing at 80 percent. The one pointed at a busy street was standing strong at 60 percent. Throughout long-term testing, we put the camera in a business parking area that saw a good quantity of weekly traffic. This drained pipes the camera to the point where it needed a full charge once a month.</p>
