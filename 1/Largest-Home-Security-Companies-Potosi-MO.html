<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
