<p>We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare individuals and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
