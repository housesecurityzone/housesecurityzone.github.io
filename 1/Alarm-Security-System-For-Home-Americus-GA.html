Wyze's just recently launched Total Motion Capture resolves this problem for $1.50 per month per camera. It enables recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly begins another, with no gaps in between. Recordings are simple to discover under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, but we do not recommend that for home security due to the fact that if it's taken, you don't have a backup.</p>

In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with a given video recorder before buying.</p>
