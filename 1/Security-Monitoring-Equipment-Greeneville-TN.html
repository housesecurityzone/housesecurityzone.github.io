<p>Power-over-Ethernet switches apply just to NVR systems, however they eliminated other elements that would be needed for a DVR system, like additional power sources and the BNC cables used to link cameras to the DVR. Instead, when you link a PoE switch to your network, you have actually got a source of power and a method of sending data to your NVR all in one plan. The greatest factor to consider when selecting which type of PoE switch to buy is the variety of cameras that will be on your system. The next factor to consider is how likely you are to scale up in the future.</p>
