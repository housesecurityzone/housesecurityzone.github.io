<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is an enjoyment to utilize as well (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you wish to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a knowing curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's excellent, though. If you do not currently have an Arlo camera or two in place, you're going to require to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all link to the center (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can imply there are range problems.</p>
