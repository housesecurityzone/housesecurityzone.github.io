Equipment Cost - With some companies, like SimpliSafe, you pay for all the equipment upfront. You can begin for about $200 or less for essential equipment, and paid monitoring isn't required.

You can acquire ADT services and products straight from the company or from an licensed independent dealer. Customer care and quality differ from dealership to dealer, so buy from ADT straight when you can or deal with a dealer you trust.
