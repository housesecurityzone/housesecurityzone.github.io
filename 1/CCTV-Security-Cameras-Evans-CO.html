<p>The night vision on this camera is praised time and once again in customer reviews, and it provides a crisp picture up to 32 feet. And even though the app and software are easy to work with, it's a little bit of a disappointment that you can't incorporate this camera with any smart home hubs or gadgets. A great deal of smart cameras can be configured to do things like this, however few make things as simple as Hive have done within their app, and I salute them for that. Tech is expected to make our lives easier and Hive's community measures up to that. It's all the function with no aggravation.</p>
