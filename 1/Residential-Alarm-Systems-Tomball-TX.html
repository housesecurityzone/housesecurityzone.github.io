<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>

<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
